	<h2>About me</h2>
	
		I'm a game developer an designer, amateur musician and wannabe one-man-army.
		</br>
		</br>

	<h2>Current projects</h2>
	
		<b>First Leaf</b> [Started in June 2013]
		</br>
		C++ engine for a 2D game using <a href="allegro.cc">Allegro</a> and <a href="box2d.org">Box2D</a>.
		</br>
		It will kill three birds with one stone:
		</br>
		It is serving as my final project for my college degree. (See Zentract).
		</br>
		It is making me learn C++ and Box2D in the deepest way I am able without being taught by industry professionals. Also Allegro.
		</br>
		It is forcing me to learn how a whole c++ game engine works, struggle with it and research and solve the problems.
		</br>
		</br>
		
		<b>Zentract</b> [Started in October 2013]
		</br>
		A branch of First Leaf for the final project of my college degree.
		</br>
		The main difference is that it will be using a discrete event simulator instead of a main loop.
		</br>
		</br>
		</br>
		
	<h2>Finished projects</h2>
	
		<b>Squower</b> [May, June 2011]
		</br>
		Done to work in a team of 3 different individuals. 
		</br>
		My last project in AS3.

	<h2>On hold projects</h2>

		<b>Night-long Walk</b> [November 2010]
		</br>
		A 2d platform game with magnets. 
		</br>
		I stopped development it in an already advance state because Super Meat Boy launched with almost the
		</br>
		exactly same mechanics in World 5. Even more so, the visual aesthetics were unusually common in Flash
		</br>
		games. This game was deemed to feel generic and forgettable if released in that moment.
