			<b>FirstLeaf</b> 
			</br>
			[Started in July 2013, continuous development]
			</br>
			C++ engine for a 2D game using <a href="allegro.cc">Allegro</a> and <a href="box2d.org">Box2D</a>.
			</br>
			It will kill three birds with one stone:
			</br>
			1. I'm learning C++, Box2D and Allegro in the deepest way possible allowed withouth being taught by industry professionals.
			</br>
			2. I'm learning how a whole C++ game engine works. I'm struggling, researching and solving real issues by myself.
			</br>
			3. It is serving as basis for the final project of my college degree. (See Zentract).

			<b>Zentract</b> 
			</br>
			[Started in October 2013, expected finish in March 2014]
			</br>
			A branch of FirstLeaf for the final project of my college degree in the UPV.
			</br>
			The main topic of study is the usage and profit of a discrete event simulator instead of a main loop.

		<b>Withering Noise</b>

		<b>Night-long Walk</b> 
		</br>
		[Started on November 2010, Unfinished but totally playable]
		</br>
		A 2d platform game with magnets. 
		</br>
		I stopped development it in an already advance state because Super Meat Boy launched with almost the
		</br>
		exactly same mechanics in World 5. Even more so, the visual aesthetics were unusually common in Flash
		</br>
		games. This game was deemed to feel generic and forgettable if released in that moment.
